SlimLink URL Shortener

Project Overview
SlimLink is a simple URL shortening service built using React for the frontend. Users can input long URLs, and the app will generate a shortened URL. The project currently includes a responsive, user-friendly interface with a NavBar, input field for the long URL, and functionality to display the shortened URL.

Features
Responsive Design: The app layout adjusts to different screen sizes using Bootstrap.
URL Input: Users can enter long URLs, which will be shortened (currently simulated in the frontend).
Shortened URL Display: The app displays the shortened URL after submission.
NavBar: Includes navigation links for "About Us", "Plans", and "Login".
Logo: Displays a custom logo in the NavBar and above the main heading.
